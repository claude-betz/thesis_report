\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Background to Study}
Motion draws the attention of an observer. A moving object in the field of
motion of an observer of a certain scene could hint towards danger or another
sort of change to said observer's immediate environment. Advancements in
technology necessitate the same level of sophistication in terms of
reliability, speed, resistance to ``noise'' and the ability to generalize that
humans or other animals exhibit in performing this task.

Motion Tracking is a very application specific endeavour. Different Approaches to
reliably track the motion of pedestrian in a city scene may fall short at
detecting the motion of an animal in the woods. Even after evaluation the
trade-offs between various approach, this problem still requires considerable fine
tuning of model parameters assumptions before arrival at a reliable solution
to a problem.  For example, the introduction of occlusion to a scene, or changes
in illumination of a scene can all drastically affect model performance should
it not intrinsically account for this.

\section{Objectives}\label{introduction_objectives}

The problem investigated in this study are firstly approaches to motion tracking
in its simplest form.

\subsection{Purpose of study}
The purpose of this study is the building of a piece software that can be used
to analyse scenes and allow users to isolate objects of interest within said
scenes

\section{Scope and Limitations}
The scope of this these includes: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item A review of literature relevant to the problem, and usage of
        said literature in the development of the Motion Tracking System.
    \item The application of relevant Project Management methodologies in the
        achievement of the overall system objective.
    \item Hierarchical design of the Motion Tracking System at various levels.
        In line with user requirements and technical specifications.
    \item The development of the System in line with good software development
        practices according to the specified design.
    \item Testing of functionality at a unit and system level
    \item Benchmarking of Motion Tracking System performance both at a
        functional and user level.
    \item Treatment of results, conclusions and recommendations.
\end{itemize}

This thesis is a 12-week undertaking.
