\chapter{Methodology}\label{chapter_methodology}
This Chapter aims to outline and sequence the project phases necessary for the completion
of the objectives of this project as detailed in
Section~\ref{introduction_objectives}. It does so by initially defining the
phases by the tasks they involve. Based on this set of well defined phases, this
Chapter decides on a set of process models/methodologies that govern the
progression of the project through it's various phases. The testing, data
collection and analysis methodologies guiding the subsequent generation of
results and conclusions are also elaborated on within this Chapter.

\section{Project Phases and Process Models }
An overview of the project phases is presented in Figure~\ref{fig:methodology_phases_and_process_models}.
In addition to this, the Figure also highlights the appropriate process
models that govern the different project phases. Both the project phases and
process models are subsequently elaborated on.

\subsection{Project phases}
The various project phases involved in the development of the MT System are
developed below. They correspond by number and name to the project phases presented in
Figure~\ref{fig:methodology_phases_and_process_models}.

\subsubsection{Phase 1: Research and literature review}
This phase serves as an initial surveying of the broad field of motion tracking to
determine what the various established approaches to the motion tracking are.
The outcome of this phase is a refined scope in terms of what approaches will be
trialled to meet the user requirements outlined in
Section~\ref{introduction_user_requirements}. This phase begins in
Chapter~\ref{chapter_literature_review}, a literature review which broadly
surveys the field, the outcome of which is a refined scope that clearly states
the approaches to be trialled. Chapter~\ref{chapter_theoretical_framework} then
researches and breaks down the selected approaches in sufficient detail to allow for
theoretically driven design and implementation of a solution to the motion
tracking problem.

\subsubsection{Phase 2: Planning and preliminary design}
This phase involves a translation of the relevant literature and theoretical
foundation from phase 1 into a feasible design for the MT System. The scope of
this project requires a logical delineation between the front- and back-end
functionalities. This Phase is documented in the design laid out in
Chapter~\ref{chapter_design}.

It is important to note that while phases 1 and 2 are largely linear. The Nature
of phases 3 to 5 is iterative, and make up the bulk of this project. Hence we
make the use of the spiral process model, to ensure that the outcome of each iteration
is a working MT System prototype.  

\subsubsection{Phase 3: Development and prototyping}
This phase involves the implementation of the planned system functionality in a
modular fashion. Given the theoretically driven approach of this project. There
is a high correlation between the theory outlined in
Chapter~\ref{chapter_theoretical_framework} and outcomes of this phase which are
presented in Chapter~\ref{chapter_implementation}.

\subsubsection{Phase 4: Experimentation and testing}
This phase is focused on the verification of the implementations on a
functional level. Experiments are performed in order to
assess the performance of various MT System sub-modules as well as to gauge the
extent to which the MT System meets it's overall user requirements. The
outcomes of this phase are tightly linked phase 5 within iterations of the
spiral model. 

\subsubsection{Phase 5: Data collection and analysis}
This phase is also under occurs under the jurisdiction of the spiral model. Per
it's name, it involves the data collection and analysis of the outcomes of the
experiments performed in phase 4. The insights gained from this phase are inputs
to the subsequent iterations through phases 3 to 5 of the spiral model. The result
being an iterative convergence refinement the MT System. During later
iterations, the data collected and analysed is forms part of the results
presented in Chapter~\ref{chapter_results}.

\subsubsection{Phase 6: System integration and integration testing}
This phase is concerned with the integration of front- and back-end subsystems that
are sufficiently developed. To this effect there are several design
considerations in the early stages of the project life cycle such
as language choice and compiler compatibility of the front- and back-end
subsystem implementations. The outcomes of this phase is a fully integrated MT
System, the performance of which gauged according to how well it meets the
defined user requirements.  

\subsubsection{Phase 7: Conclusions and future plans}
This phase formalises the implications of the data collected in the various
iterations of prototyping. Tying the results back to objectives and user
requirements of the project.
It addressed possible improvements that are beyond the initial project scope
and not achievable within the project time-frame.

\section{Hierarchy of Process Models}
Due to the scale of the undertaking, different process models were employed to
address different aspects of the project.
Outlined below are the two process models employed in ensuring the
successful completion of the MT System within the allocated time. The phases
each process model corresponds to is clearly illustrated in
Figure~\ref{fig:methodology_phases_and_process_models}. 

\subsection{V-model}
The process model chosen to guide the overall progression through the phases of
this study is the V-model. This choice is tied to a number of reasons: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item It is simple to use.
    \item It provides a tight link between overall design and verification 
    \item Suited to projects with well defined user requirements.
\end{itemize}

The relevant V-diagram is detailed in Figure~\ref{fig:methodology_v_diagram}. It
details the various levels of specification down to the implementation and
highlights the stages of testing and integration of the MT system.

The V-diagram enforces a linear progression through the project phases, but it
also flexibility to allow for changes at later phases in the project life cycle.
As we progress down the left side of the V, the system is defined with
increasing granularity from the level of overall system design down to the
functional design of modules within the different subsystems. This progression is mirrored on the right
side of the V in in which testing increases in granularity over the same range.
At each level there is room to for changes in design, thus this model enforces
quality control into the development life cycle.

\subsection{Spiral model}
The design task which spans phases; 4,5 and 6 as shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:methodology_phases_and_process_models} has the following
characteristic: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item It is complex in nature
    \item It has a set of clearly defined requirements. 
\end{itemize}

It is for these reasons that the spiral model is the chosen process model to
oversee these tasks. The focus on iterative design and prototyping allows for
convergence on a solution that can continuously be refined over the span of the
project. Furthermore, it guarantees that the final report can be progressively
constructed alongside the development based on the outcomes of each iteration.

\section{Data Collection Testing and Analysis}\label{methodology_testing}
Chapter~\ref{chapter_design} details the design of the MT System in terms of
front- and back- end subsystems, this design is implemented in
Chapter~\ref{chapter_implementation}. This Section aims to outline the data
collection and analysis methods that will be used when assessing the
performance of the subsystems.

\subsection{Back-end data}
The implemented back-end, comprising of a set of trackers will be run on a
standardised data set provided by the \textit{Visual Object Tracking 2017
Challenge} (VOT2017)~\cite{VOT2017}. This data set comprises of an extensive set of image
sequences exhibiting a number of the challenges to motion tracking outlined in
Section~\ref{literature_review_challenges}. 

Analysis of these sequences will be both quantitative and qualitative, the two
approaches are subsequently elaborated on.

\subsubsection{Quantitative testing and analysis}
The VOT2017 Challenge is a comprehensive motion tracking benchmarking framework,
among an advanced set of test metrics, it provides annotated ground truth values for the
image sequences, these are in the for of true bounding boxes of a target object in a
particular frame. 

Due to the relative simplicity of the implemented trackers when compared to the
state of the art. This thesis opts for a simple metric to quantitatively
benchmark tracker performance. This metric is termed the \textit{tracker
error}.
The tracker error is defined as the distance between the centroid of tracker
localization and the true centroid derived from the ground truth bounding boxes
for a particular frame in the image sequence.

\subsubsection{Qualitative testing and analysis}
Despite a quantitative analysis, there are still insights to be drawn from a
qualitative inspection of the various sequences, from which results can be tied
back to the implementation choices such as low-level feature selection etc.

\subsection{Front-end}
The testing of the front-end will be performed by performance of various input
sequences to the graphical user interface (GUI). The analysis will be in assessing the
performance of the GUI in relation to the initial user requirements of the MT
System as specified in Section~\ref{introduction_user_requirements}.
