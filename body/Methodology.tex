\section{Project Phases and Process Models}

\subsection{Phases}
The project completion can be broken down into a sequence of steps, these are
outlined below:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Research and Literature Review
    \item Planning and Preliminary Design
    \item Development and Prototyping 
    \item Experimentation and Testing
    \item Data Collection and Analysis
    \item System Integration and Integration Testing
    \item Conclusions and Future Plans
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Hierarchy of Process Models}
The Process Model chosen to guide the overall progression through the phases of
this study is the V-Model. This choice is tied to a number of reasons: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item It is simple to use.
    \item It provides a tight link between overall design and verification 
    \item Suited to projects with well defined user requirements.
    \item
\end{itemize}
