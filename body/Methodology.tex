\chapter{Methodology}\label{methodology}
This chapter aims to define the sequence of phases necessary for the completion
of the objectives of this study, originally detailed in Section
\ref{introduction_objectives} of this report.
This chapter also outlines the Process Models underlying the development
approach to the successful completion of the defined Phases.

\section{Project Phases and Process Models}
An overview of the Project Phases as well as and Process Models is presented in
Figure \ref{phases_and_process_models} below:

\subsection{Project Phases}
The Project Phases are outlined below:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Research and Literature Review
    \item Planning and Preliminary Design
    \item Development and Prototyping 
    \item Experimentation and Testing
    \item Data Collection and Analysis
    \item System Integration and Integration Testing
    \item Conclusions and Future Plans
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Hierarchy of Process Models}
\subsubsection{V-Model}
Due to the scale of different process models were employed to address different
aspects of the project.

The Process Model chosen to guide the overall progression through the phases of
this study is the V-Model. This choice is tied to a number of reasons: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item It is simple to use.
    \item It provides a tight link between overall design and verification 
    \item Suited to projects with well defined user requirements.
    \item
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Spiral Model}
The Design Task which spans Phases; 4,5 and 6 in Figure 
\ref{phases_and_process_models}, is: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Complex in nature
    \item Has a set of clearly defined requirements. 
\end{itemize}
