Chapter~\ref{chapter_results}. 

\section{Template Matching Tracker}
The Simple Template Tracker implementation was only slightly effective in
managing to track even the simplest of sequences. It is clear that Simple Template
Matching applied to every frame of a sequence does the necessary built-in
flexibility towards even subtle changes in target appearance between frames.

The Adaptive Template Tracker implementation showed some promise in solving the
tracking problem. Where the Simple Template Tracker failed in tracking the
Taxi in the Hamburg Taxi Sequence, The adaptive Tracker succeeded for the
duration of the sequence. 
The approach of updating the template with the detected region in each
$\mathbf{f}_k$ to be used in $\mathbf{f}_{k+1}$ partly allowed the tracker to
deal with changes in object appearance in subsequent frames. However, the
approach did not have a means to effectively center the detected region, hence
over long sequence the tracker would exhibit ``drift'', eventually losing the
object to be tracked as more and more background noise was added to the model at
each update.

In addition, when faced with the Challenge of Occlusion, the adaptive tracker
would -depending on it's similarity threshold, $\tau$- either fail to locate the
object in the case of a larger $\tau$ and rapid occlusion between successive
frames, $\mathbf{f}_k$ and $\mathbf{f}_{k+1}$ or add the occlusion to the target
model in the case of a lower $\tau$, and a slowly progressing occlusion between
$\mathbf{f}_k$ and $\mathbf{f}_{k+1}$ 

\section{Colour Co-occurrence Histogram Detector}
Still within the sphere of Detection-Based Tracking, and an Feature-Based
Template Matching approach, the Co-occurrence Histogram Detector was pursued largely as an
experiment to gauge, whether Template Matching Tracking can be extended to deal
with some of the Motion Tracking Challenges.
