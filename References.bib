@article{Comaniciu2003,
    abstract = {A new approach toward target representation and localization, the central component in visual tracking of nonrigid objects, is proposed. The feature histogram-based target representations are regularized by spatial masking with an isotropic kernel. The masking induces spatially-smooth similarity functions suitable for gradient-based optimization, hence, the target localization problem can be formulated using the basin of attraction of the local maxima. We employ a metric derived from the Bhattacharyya coefficient as similarity measure, and use the mean shift procedure to perform the optimization. In the presented tracking examples, the new method successfully coped with camera motion, partial occlusions, clutter, and target scale variations. Integration with motion filters and data association techniques is also discussed. We describe only a few of the potential applications: exploitation of background information, Kalman tracking using motion models, and face tracking.},

    abstract = {A general nonparametric technique is proposed for the analysis of a complex multimodal feature space and to delineate arbitrarily shaped clusters in it. The basic computational module of the technique is an old pattern recognition procedure, the mean shift. We prove for discrete data the convergence of a recursive mean shift procedure to the nearest stationary point of the underlying density function and thus its utility in detecting the modes of the density. The equivalence of the mean shift procedure to the Nadarayaâ€“Watson estimator from kernel regression and the robust M-estimators of location is also established. Algorithms for two low-level vision tasks, discontinuity preserving smoothing and image segmentation are described as applications. In these algorithms the only user set parameter is the resolution of the analysis, and either gray level or color images are accepted as input. Extensive experimental results illustrate their excellent performance.},

abstract = {Visual object tracking is a significant computer vision task which can be applied to many domains such as visual surveillance, human computer interaction, and video compression. In the literature, researchers have proposed a variety of 2D appearance models. To help readers swiftly learn the recent advances in 2D appearance models for visual object tracking, we contribute this survey, which provides a detailed review of the existing 2D appearance models. In particular, this survey takes a module-based architecture that enables readers to easily grasp the key points of visual object tracking. In this survey, we first decompose the problem of appearance modeling into two different processing stages: visual representation and statistical modeling. Then, different 2D appearance models are categorized and discussed with respect to their composition modules. Finally, we address several issues of interest as well as the remaining challenges for future research on this topic. The contributions of this survey are four-fold. First, we review the literature of visual representations according to their feature-construction mechanisms (i.e., local and global). Second, the existing statistical modeling schemes for tracking-by-detection are reviewed according to their model-construction mechanisms: generative, discriminative, and hybrid generative-discriminative. Third, each type of visual representations or statistical modeling techniques is analyzed and discussed from a theoretical or practical viewpoint. Fourth, the existing benchmark resources (e.g., source code and video datasets) are examined in this survey.},

    abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products
    formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise
    crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest.
    Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there
    has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection
    techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures
    of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis
    and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the
    need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis.
    Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based
    methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this
    manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but
    to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the
    rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass
    spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a)
    sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE),
    supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b)
    separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC),
    gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such
    as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future
    prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

    The number of useful object-tracking methods is exploding. But how are they
    related? How do they help track everything from aircraft, missiles and
    extra-terrestrial objects to people and lymphocyte cells? How can they be
    adapted to novel applications? Fundamentals of Object Tracking tells you how.
    Starting with the generic object-tracking problem, it outlines the generic
    Bayesian solution. It then shows systematically how to formulate the major
    tracking problems â€“ maneuvering, multiobject, clutter, out-of-sequence sensors â€“
    within this Bayesian framework and how to derive the standard tracking
    solutions. This structured approach makes very complex object-tracking
    algorithms accessible to the growing number of users working on real-world
    tracking problems and supports them in designing their own tracking filters
    under their unique application constraints. The book concludes with a chapter on
    issues critical to successful implementation of tracking algorithms, such as
    track initialization and merging. {\textcopyright} S. Challa, M. R. Morelande,

abstract = {As humans, we perceive the three-dimensional structure of the world around us with apparent ease. However, despite all of the recent advances in computer vision research, the dream of having a computer interpret an image at the same level as a two-year old remains elusive. Why is computer vision such a challenging problem, and what is the current state of the art?Computer Vision: Algorithms and Applications explores the variety of techniques commonly used to analyze and interpret images. It also describes challenging real-world applications where vision is being successfully used, both for specialized applications such as medical imaging and fun consumer-level tasks such as image editing and stitching, which students can apply to their own personal photos and videos.More than just a source of "recipes", this text/reference also takes a scientific approach to basic vision problems, formulating physical models of the imaging process before inverting this process to produce the best possible descriptions of a scene. Exercises are presented throughout the book, with a heavy emphasis on testing algorithms.Suitable for either an undergraduate or a graduate-level course in computer vision, this textbook focuses on basic techniques that work under real-world conditions and encourages students to push their creative boundaries.Dr. Richard Szeliski has over twenty years' experience in computer vision research, most notably at Digital Equipment Corporation and Microsoft.},

abstract = {Data compression is one of the main contributing factors in the explosive growth in information technology. Without it, a number of consumer and commercial products, such as DVD, videophone, digital camera, MP3, video-streaming and wireless PCS, would have been virtually impossible. Transforming the data to a frequency or other domain enables even more efficient compression. By illustrating this intimate link, The Transform and Data Compression Handbook serves as a much-needed handbook for a wide range of researchers and engineers. The authors describe various discrete transforms and their applications in different disciplines. They cover techniques, such as adaptive quantization and entropy coding, that result in significant reduction in bit rates when applied to the transform coefficients. With clear and concise presentations of the ideas and concepts, as well as detailed descriptions of the algorithms, the authors provide important insight into the applications and their limitations. Data compression is an essential step towards the efficient storage and transmission of information. The Transform and Data Compression Handbook provides a wealth of information regarding different discrete transforms and demonstrates their power and practicality in data compression.},
