    abstract = {A new approach toward target representation and localization, the central component in visual tracking of nonrigid objects, is proposed. The feature histogram-based target representations are regularized by spatial masking with an isotropic kernel. The masking induces spatially-smooth similarity functions suitable for gradient-based optimization, hence, the target localization problem can be formulated using the basin of attraction of the local maxima. We employ a metric derived from the Bhattacharyya coefficient as similarity measure, and use the mean shift procedure to perform the optimization. In the presented tracking examples, the new method successfully coped with camera motion, partial occlusions, clutter, and target scale variations. Integration with motion filters and data association techniques is also discussed. We describe only a few of the potential applications: exploitation of background information, Kalman tracking using motion models, and face tracking.},

abstract = {A general nonparametric technique is proposed for the analysis of a complex multimodal feature space and to delineate arbitrarily shaped clusters in it. The basic computational module of the technique is an old pattern recognition procedure, the mean shift. We prove for discrete data the convergence of a recursive mean shift procedure to the nearest stationary point of the underlying density function and thus its utility in detecting the modes of the density. The equivalence of the mean shift procedure to the Nadaraya–Watson estimator from kernel regression and the robust M-estimators of location is also established. Algorithms for two low-level vision tasks, discontinuity preserving smoothing and image segmentation are described as applications. In these algorithms the only user set parameter is the resolution of the analysis, and either gray level or color images are accepted as input. Extensive experimental results illustrate their excellent performance.},

@article{Aldhaheri2014,
    abstract = {— In this paper we present a new method for detecting and
        classifying moving objects into humans and vehicles from a video
            surveillance scene. In this approach, the moving objects are firstly
            detected from the background using a background subtraction
            technique. Background subtraction algorithms are implemented in a
            MATLAB environment. A comparison for all the algorithms was made to
            determine which background subtraction algorithm performs better
            with the proposed classifying algorithm. The algorithms were then
            tested using more than a video and many frames of the video was
            tested. Secondly, edge detection of moving objects was performed
            using Canny or Prewitt operations, while bounding boxes were
            implemented over the moving objects. Edge detection and bounding
            boxes were used before the classification step to simplify the
            classification. Finally, classifying the moving object into humans
            and vehicles was accomplished by finding the height-width ratio of
            the bounding box around the moving object in each frame and
            estimating the speed of the moving object from two consecutive
            frames in the video stream. The results found were fairly good and
            the wrong classification was due to the bounding boxes not correctly
            covering the moving objects. The background subtraction step and the
            classification step were tested using different video sequences. A
            comparison was made between the combination of each background
            subtraction technique and the classification algorithm; the false
            classification results are given. Although the proposed
            classification algorithm in this paper is simple and easy to be
            implemented, the results obtained are very satisfactory and the
            accuracy is very good Keywords—background subtraction,
        classification, moving object detection.},

abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products
formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise
crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest.
Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there
has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection
techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures
of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis
and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the
need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis.
Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based
methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this
manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but
to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the
rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass
spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a)
sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE),
supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b)
separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC),
gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such
as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future
prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

The number of useful object-tracking methods is exploding. But how are they
related? How do they help track everything from aircraft, missiles and
extra-terrestrial objects to people and lymphocyte cells? How can they be
adapted to novel applications? Fundamentals of Object Tracking tells you how.
Starting with the generic object-tracking problem, it outlines the generic
Bayesian solution. It then shows systematically how to formulate the major
tracking problems – maneuvering, multiobject, clutter, out-of-sequence sensors –
within this Bayesian framework and how to derive the standard tracking
solutions. This structured approach makes very complex object-tracking
algorithms accessible to the growing number of users working on real-world
tracking problems and supports them in designing their own tracking filters
under their unique application constraints. The book concludes with a chapter on
issues critical to successful implementation of tracking algorithms, such as
track initialization and merging. {\textcopyright} S. Challa, M. R. Morelande,
