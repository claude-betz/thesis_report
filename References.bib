abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products
formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise
crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest.
Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there
has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection
techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures
of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis
and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the
need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis.
Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based
methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this
manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but
to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the
rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass
spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a)
sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE),
supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b)
separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC),
gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such
as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future
prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

The number of useful object-tracking methods is exploding. But how are they
related? How do they help track everything from aircraft, missiles and
extra-terrestrial objects to people and lymphocyte cells? How can they be
adapted to novel applications? Fundamentals of Object Tracking tells you how.
Starting with the generic object-tracking problem, it outlines the generic
Bayesian solution. It then shows systematically how to formulate the major
tracking problems – maneuvering, multiobject, clutter, out-of-sequence sensors –
within this Bayesian framework and how to derive the standard tracking
solutions. This structured approach makes very complex object-tracking
algorithms accessible to the growing number of users working on real-world
tracking problems and supports them in designing their own tracking filters
under their unique application constraints. The book concludes with a chapter on
issues critical to successful implementation of tracking algorithms, such as
track initialization and merging. {\textcopyright} S. Challa, M. R. Morelande,
